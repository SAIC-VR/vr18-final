## Project Description 
In this project you will create a virtual reality experience for time travel.  Given time constraints you will need to choose the level of detail and size of your effort.  The only constraints are you must have two different time experiences [its up to you to define what a a time travel experience means]. 

## Storyline
This can be a continuation of your first project, but you still need to write down a few paragraphs of the narrative (250-300 words) to introduce your storyline. 

Discuss the elements you plan to use to generate the feelings and emotions presented by the environment. 
What was the *feeling* at the beginning of the experience? What techniques do you plan to use to change that to the feeling of the experience? Try to describe the setting of your environment. 

Describe what is the user experience:

| Experience | descricption |
|- | - |
| see 👁 | |
| hear 👂🏼 | |
| think 🧠| |
| feel 😭😍 | |
| interact with 👋🏻 | |

How does the experience evolve? If your VR experience does not have an actual storyline, jot down the background for how you developed the idea for your piece. What was in your mind? Why do you think your idea is a good one? What was your inspiration? 

What are the interactions that you expect the user to experience in the virtual envrionment? Do they grab, touch, enable actions, sounds, animations, etc. with their presence? What is the goal?

Remember you still need to produce a **storyboard** even if you are not developing a narrative type experience.

# Project Requirements

There are multiple required components to each project, which are described in more detail below. Each project will require the following:

> - Project Proposal [10%]
> - Project Execution [70%]
> - Project Report [20%]

**The contribution to the final project grade is listed behind each section and each section is required to receive a passing grade for the project.**

_______

## Project Proposal [10%]

Projects require some planning, this includes a summary of the project, the goals of your project, and a plan on how you will achieve the goals. The proposal should include the following:

 - Title of the project
 - Your name
 - Abstract/summary of what do you want to achieve and why, this should only be a few sentences long and will be used to guide the evaluation of the project
 - Resources needed (e.g. Unity,  Unreal Engine, STEAM VR, VRTK, etc. Hardware: HTC Vive, Google Cardboard, Oculs GO, etc.)
 - Plan on what you want to do with milestones and dates, it can be a simple bulleted list.

Fill out the [Project01 Proposal](https://goo.gl/forms/vWfRcBTA8Oqx1Z8D2) form by **Nov 21 @ 11:59pm**

## Project Execution [70%] 
> Check revision dates

Implementation of project is the execution of the milestones to achieve the project goal(s).  As you develop your project, you will be applying an iterative process that will likely require the adjustment of milestones and goals.  These adjustments should be captured in your projects final report.

## Presentations
> Each project will be presented in class, based on a random selection. 10 minutes are assigned for the presentation and 5 for Q&A. Everyone shuold be prepared to provide positve feedback and constructive critisism.

Before your presentation you must:
- **Test** your application on the computer that will be connected to the VR device (Vive, Oculus, cardboard, etc.)
- Make an **executable bundle** before the presentation
- Be ready to present your project by just cliking on the executable. No Unity editor at this point.

## Project Report [20%]

Report on project, simple web page with a summary of effort. 
> Report should include the following: 
 - Title of the project
 - Author
 - Abstract/summary of what you want to achieve and why, this should only be a few sentences long and will be used to guide the evaluation of project
 - Video capture of the project
 - Resources used (e.g. Unity and HTC Vive, Google Cardboard and Unreal Engine)
 - Results of project, how you did with milestones and dates and any adjustments you needed to make.
 - Lessons learned in the project
